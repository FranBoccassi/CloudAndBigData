## Introduction

StackOverflow Questions & Answers is a project that tries to analyze the efficiency of the most popular server among programmers, which has a very good reputation.

This analysis tries to demonstrate to what extent it is true that it is one of the best performing servers in the world.

### Description of the problem

We often find ourselves with doubts about how to make certain code in programming, we tend to think that why are we going to "reinvent the wheel" since many of the things we need to do when we develop a programming project, is based on reusing parts of code with different functions, these are usually the subject of our doubts, how those who have already done it will have done it, how it will be the most efficient way ... To all this in most cases we find support in StackOverflow.

### Need for Big Data

Being able to see each and every one of the questions along with their respective answers, reaches an excessively large size, due to the fact that it brings together a community on a world scale. In addition, it serves as a backup for all types of programming languages. For this reason, we have made scripts that facilitate data collection and also generate different contrasts of information, for this we use a Google Cloud virtual machine instance with 4vCPU and 3.6Gb of memory.

### Solution

For the developed solution we have obtained the most up-to-date dataset's, on these we carry out the following processes: filter, analyze, save and represent the information obtained; according to the different aspects that we have taken into account, such as: the average response time, the most frequent tags, that is, the most used languages ​​and those tags that have not obtained a specific solution.

Which helps us in the first place, for example, to clarify the evidence of the number of unsolved questions.

Here we leave the link for the datasets that we have used, they are too wide to upload to GitHub:
